The semantics of RDF is designed to reflect the realities of a shared and decentralized information system spanning the whole world: no one ever has a complete grasp on the data, people use different names to refer to the same thing (and sometimes also the same name to refer to different things), no-one is entitled to modify someone else's data, what is not in the data at hand may nonetheless be true, etc. Some of these criteria have names, like the Open World Assumption (OWA) or the No Unique Name Assumption (NUNA). Some, like referential transparency, are so deeply baked into the formalism that they a barely noticed. Some only become visible through the absence of certain constructs like e.g. negation.

Some of these semantic fixings are rather counter-intuitive to application developers accustomed to closed environments e.g. driven by relational database systems, as those systems tend to take a rather opposing stance: in an in-house application the data is expected to be complete, what is not in the database is false, everything has exactly one name, etc.

Environments focusing on the integration of data tend to have a different perspective then applications optimized to put that data to use. This tension between data integration semantics for the open semantic web and application semantics for in-house use of such data has frustrated application developers since the start of the Semantic Web. At the time a popular intuition was that mechanisms should be added to the RDF semantics machinery that allowed to put into effect on demand more restrictive semantics, tailored to the needs of applications. However, such mechanisms have never materialized and one of the reasons might have been the problem of how to describe the boundaries of such a change of semantics regime, even more so after the RDF 1.1 WG failed to standardize a semantics of named graphs.
Nested graphs do offer the chance to rectify this issue as they provide a semantically sound handle to identify graphs of RDF data.


## Semantics Aspects

Establishing the right set of semantic features is of course a task on its own, but some candidates seem pretty obvious:

+ unasserted assertions, suppressing endorsement of contentious statements
+ closed world assumption, suppressing unpredictability
+ unique name assumption, suppressing co-denotation
+ referential opacity, suppressing entailments
+ negation, suppressing unwanted statements

The following vocabulary provides a term to introduce a semantics and offers a few possible applications.

```
DEF

nng:SemanticsAspect a rdf:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "An aspect of a semantics that differs from RDFâ€™s default." .
	
nng:UNA a nng:SemanticsAspect ;
    rdfs:label "Unique Name Assumption" ;
    rdfs:comment "Each entity is denoted by exactly one identifier." 

nng:CWA a nng:SemanticsAspect ;
    rdfs:label "Closed World Assumption" ;
    rdfs:comment "The data is complete." 

nng:HYP a nng:SemanticsAspect ;
    rdfs:label "Hypothetical, unasserted Assertion" ;
    rdfs:comment "A graph documented, but not asserted." 

nng:OPA a nng:SemanticsAspect ;
    rdfs:label "Referential Opacity" ;
    rdfs:comment "All IRIs are interpreted to refer to entities in the real world, but only in the specific syntactic form provided (i.e. no co-denotation with other identifiers referring to the same entities)." .

nng:NEG a nng:SemanticsAspect ;
    rdfs:label "Negated" ;
    rdfs:comment "A graph considered false." 
```


## Semantics Profiles

From such aspects then semantic profiles can be constructed, that allow to conveniently establish environments tailored to specific needs. We could for example imagine that the following set of semantics profiles would support many if not most applications:

- `APP` - application intuitions like they are typically found in RDBMS backed systems
- `CIT` - referential opacity, as in Named Graphs, Carroll et al 2005, to faithfully record graphs, supporting use cases like versioning, explainable AI, warrants
- `TYP` - entailment-optimized semantics as hinted at in https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-star/2021May/0038.html

We can also see other, less specific uses of nested graphs concerned with semantics issues like:
- blank node scoping via specific blank node scoping graphs (maybe to be called "bGraphs")
- entailment scoping to e.g. state that within some nested graphs no contradictions are allowed (a SPARQL dataset itself constituting an outermost nested graph)

The following vocabulary combines semantics aspects and [naming semantics](#graph-types) into semantics profiles catered to different application scenarios.

```
DEF

nng:SemanticsProfile  a rdf:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "A combination of semantics aspects into a coherent whole." .

nng:hasAspect a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:comment "Describes semantics aspects of a semantics profile" .


nng:APP a nng:SemanticsProfile ;
    rdfs:label "Application Profile" ;
    rdfs:comment "A semantics profile capturing typical intuitions of in-house application development" ;
    nng:hasAspect nng:UNA , 
                  nng:CWA ,
                  nng:Address ,      # we discourage overloading of graph names
                  nng:Identifier ,
                  nng:GraphSource .

nng:CIT a nng:SemanticsProfile ;
    rdfs:label "Citation Profile" ;
    rdfs:comment "A semantics profile capturing the semantics of Named Graphs, Carroll et al 2005, with the purpose to faithfully record graph instances with syntactic precision." ;
    nng:hasAspect nng:OPA ,
                  nng:Address ,
                  nng:Identifier ,
                  nng:GraphType .

nng:LOG a nng:SemanticsProfile ;
    rdfs:label "Logic Profile" ;
    rdfs:comment "A profile to enable reasoning over nested graphs" ;
    nng:hasAspect nng:Address ,
                  nng:Content ,
                  nng:GraphType .
```

## Practical Application

We can see two ways how such semantics profiles can be applied to RDF data: either they resort to an [transclusion](#graph-literals) construct based on regular RDF or they apply some syntactic sugar. Both approaches will be investigated below.

The practical problem that any approach on configurable semantics has to solve is how to guarantee that the RDF data so qualified can never be mistaken for regular RDF data. If the data would be introduced as a regular snippet of RDF, accompanied by an additional statement declaring its specific semantics, there could be no guarantee that an RDF processor is aware of that semantics fixing before deriving possibly unwanted entailments or in other ways processing the data in unintended ways.


### Transclusion enabling Configurable Semantics

The transclusion mechanism introduced [above](#import-via-transclusion) allows to import graph literals with extremely restricted semantics. Adding to the transclusion a semantics instruction allows to tailor the semantics of the transcluded graph to the desired effect. We already gave the following example:
```
THIS nng:transcludes [
    rdf:value ":s :p :o"^^nng:Graph ;
    nng:semantics nng:APP
] .
```
To make this arrangement more usable and also more tight, we could define proper subproperties of `nng:transcludes`, like e.g. `nng:transcludesAPP`:
```
nng:transcludesAPP rdfs:subPropertyOf nng:transcludes ;
                   rdfs:range nng:APP .
```
This allows a streamlined transclusion of RDF data into a graph with very specific semantics.
```
THIS nng:transcludesAPP ":s :p :o"^^nng:Graph .
```
Integrating such transclusions into regular RDF assertions is rather seamless as well, e.g.:
```
:Bob :claims [ nng:transcludesCIT ":s :p :o"^^nng:Graph ].
```

It isn't hard to define tailored semantics solutions from the building blocks provided so far. We might for example start from the following construct, which expresses that the list of Alice's things follows the usual application intuitions (i.e. it is not concerned with syntactic fidelity, it is complete and the unique name assumption applies):
```
:Alice :has [ rdf:value "(:D :E :F)"^^nng:Graph ;
              nng:semantics nng:Interpretation ,
                            nng:UNA ,
                            nng:CWA ]
```
Because that's rather involved we create a shorter description of the desired semantics:  
```
ex:List a nng:SemanticsProfile ;
        nng:semantics nng:Interpretation ,
                      nng:UNA ,
                      nng:CWA .
```
And apply it:
```
:Alice :has [ rdf:value "( :D :E :F)"^^nng:Graph ;
              nng:semantics ex:List ]
```
That's still not very elegant, so let's define a property:
```
ex:transcludesList rdfs:subPropertyOf nng:transcludes ;
                   rdfs:range ex:List .
```
And apply that:
```
:Alice :has [ ex:transcludesList "( :D :E :F )"^^nng:Graph ]
```
That's of course a bit much for one list, but it may pay off in an application context where we know that certain data sources are indeed complete and well kept and therefore it's safe to overrule the integration focused standard semantics of RDF.


### Syntactic Sugar for Configurable Semantics

> [TODO]  
>
> This syntactic sugar is not tested yet and needs more work. The re-use of prepended square brackets to not declare a name but a semantics may cause more irritation than comfort.

The following syntactic sugar aims to express transclusion with configurable semantics even more succinctly. An RDF graph literal is prepended with an argument specifying the intended semantics, re-using the already familiar square bracket syntax, e.g.:

[APP]":a :b :c , :d" :e :f .

Because of the prepended argument the explicit datatype declaration can be omitted.
Prepending the semantics fixing ensures that it can not be overlooked by a conforming parser. 

The following examples show some possible scenarios, involving both aspects and profiles:
```
[APP]" :a :b :c , :d " :e :f .
:g :h [LOG]" :h :i :k " .
:l :m [HYP,OPA]" :n :o :p " ,
      [NEG,CIT]" :q :r :s " .
```
Note that mixing semantics profiles is not advisable with the profiles suggested above, as properties might contradict each other. In principle however profiles and aspects can be combined in modular fashion. If contradictions occur, the fixings of inner nested graphs overrule those of the graphs enclosing them. Contradictions within the same nested graph can't be resolved automatically and have to be interpreted as logical `OR`.


### Term Semantics Syntactic Sugar


To make the application of configurable semantics more precise we explore a variant of RDF literals that targets individual terms. 

A popular example to motivate referential opacity is the Superman comic, with the reporter Louis Lane not being aware that her crush Superman is in fact the same person as her slightly dull colleague Clark Kent. This can precisely be modelled with a referentially opaque semantics applied only to the identifier for Superman: 
```
:LouisLane :loves [OPA]":Superman" .
```
Note how the references to Louis Lane and the concept of loving are still referentially transparent, as they should be, and solely the reference to Superman is constrained to refer only to that specific persona of the extra-terrestrial character Kal-El, but never to its alternative persona Clark Kent.

Here the square bracket prefix notation is used not to name the term - there's no need for that - but to indicate a certain semantics. This syntax in combination with the literal guarantees that the reference to Superman is always interpreted with the appropriate semantics. In this special datatype declaration may be omitted.

> [TODO]
>
> This syntactic sugar is not solidly defined yet. It would be nice to have but still needs some work.
> A slightly less daring, but also less succinct variant would be a simple property list combined with a term literal:
>    [nng:semantics nng:Opaque]":Superman"















## transclusion


### quotation
```
DEF

nng:statedAs a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:range nng:GraphLiteral ;
    rdfs:comment "The object describes the original syntactic form of a graph" .
```

The following example shows how this can be used to document some normalization:
```
[]{ :s :p :o } nng:statedAs ":S :p :O"^^nng:Graph
```
In the next example the literal is accompanied by a hash value to improve security:
```
[]{ :s :p :o } nng:statedAs [
    rdf:value ":S :p :O"^^nng:Graph ;
    nng:hash "72511fef12df97439b16ecda1415f98a"^^MD5
]
```
Note that while the graph literal is accompanying an assertion of the same type, itself it is unasserted.

### reification
```
DEF

nng:StatementGraph a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:subClassOf rdf:Statement, nng:GraphLiteral ;
    rdfs:comment "A Graph Literal describing the meaning of an RDF graph" .

nng:states a rdf:Property ;
    rdfs:range nng:StatementGraph ;
    rdfs:comment "The literal object describes the original meaning of a graph" .
```
To safe us from discussions about what Bob said verbatim, but concentrate on the meaning of what he said, we would reformulate the above assertion as:
```
:Bob nng:states ":Moon :madeOf :Cheese"^^nng:Graph .
```
Again, the graph literal is not asserted (and we have no intention to do so), but we are also not bound or even fixated on its syntactic accuracy. We just get along the fact.

To be free in the choice of properties, the following modelling primitive can be used:
```
:Bob :uttered [
    rdf:value ":Moon :madeOf :Cheese"^^nng:Graph ;
    a nng:StatementGraph .
] 
```
Note that by default no entailments would be derived from the graph literal. Only the additional typing of the literal as statement graph will allow RDF engines to derive further facts and e.g. replace `:Moon` by `:moon`.

Mapped to RDF standard reification this would be equal to:
```
:Bob :uttered [
    a rdf:Statement ;
    rdf:subject :Moon ;
    rdf:predicate :madeOf ;
    rdf:object :Cheese .
]
```


### Literalization - Referentially Opaque Assertions

the literalized graph is indeed asserted. This semantics could be specified by means of the following vocabulary:
```
DEF

nng:LiteralizedGraph a rdfs:Class ;
    rdfs:comment "A quoted assertion. IRIs are interpreted, but *verbatim*, so to say, as their literal form is significant, e.g. the IRIs `:Superman`and `:ClarkKent` can't be used interchangeably although they refer to the same thing. This is a semantics quite close to the RDF-star CG proposal and to Notation3." .

nng:statesLiterally a rdf:Property ;
	rdfs:range nng:GraphLiteral ;
    rdfs:comment "The object describes the meaning of a graph when provided in this specific syntactic form" .
```
It would be used as:
```
:Bob nng:statesLiterally ":Moon :madeOf :Cheese"^^nng:Graph .
```
or, to be more free in the use of vocabulary:
```
:Bob :muttered [
	rdf:value ":Moon :madeOf :Cheese"^^nng:Graph ;
	a nng:LiteralizedGraph.
] 
```



## inclusion + transclusion


```
DEF

nng:includes a rdf:Property,
    rdfs:subPropertyOf owl:imports ;
    rdfs:domain nng:Graph ;
    rdfs:range nng:GraphLiteral ;
    rdfs:comment "Includes the literal as regular RDF data into the current graph, like owl:imports does for RDF ontologies." .
```

The respective property is defined as:
```
DEF

nng:transcludes a rdf:Property,
    rdfs:subPropertyOf owl:imports ;
    rdfs:domain nng:Graph ;
    rdfs:range nng:GraphLiteral ;
    rdfs:comment "Transcludes the literal via reference. Transcluding a graph literal provides certain immutability guarantees for the transcluded graph." .
```
